  <p>
    I'm Jon Jandoc, a front-end engineer and architect in Los Angeles. I build
    internet stuff for causes that I give a damn about. My work has been used to
    <a href="https://www.jdate.com">help people find love</a>,
    <a href="http://freedomtomarry.org/">fight for marriage equality</a>,
    <a href="https://www.malarianomore.org/">relieve malaria</a>,
    <a href="https://standuptocancer.org/">cure cancer</a>,
    <a href="https://barackobama.com/">honor past presidents</a>, and
    <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/">try to elect new ones</a>.

  <p>
    Writing accessible, performant, maintainable, testable code is my jam.
    Mentoring others and building engineeering cultures to do the same is my
    jam. The
    <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>
    is also my jam.

    Currently I'm the Principal UI Engineer at
    <a href="https://www.bambee.com/">Bambee</a>. I help organize the
    <a href="https://www.vuejsla.com/">local Vue.js meetups</a>
    and otherwise try my best to be engaged with the dev community.

  <p>I've been meaning to blog more.</p>

Sometimes it's fun to see how the other side lives. We'll take a look at what it takes to build a component in both Vue and React. For the React developers out there who may be Vue-curious, this talk aims to illustrate the many parallel concepts and show how easy it is to take their existing knowledge of React and apply it to Vue. For the Vue developers who are unfortunate enough to be forced to work on a React project, this talk will get you up to speed with what React looks like in a "post-hooks" world.
